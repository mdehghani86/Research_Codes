# AI-Driven Decision Making (AIDM) Framework

The **AI-Driven Decision Making (AIDM) framework** is an open-source system that integrates **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** with **Generative AI (GPT-4)** to support structured supplier selection and other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems.  
It combines mathematical algorithms, a Gradio-based interface, and Excel reporting to enable both human experts and AI-generated experts to participate in decision-making.

## Features

- **Python implementation with Gradio interface**  
- **Mathematical algorithms**: AHP eigenvalue method, consistency validation  
- **Virtual expert generation**: GPT-4 powered input and weighting  
- **Comprehensive Excel reporting** with 12 detailed worksheets  
- **Example configurations and test cases** for quick setup

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdehghani86/Research-Codes.git
   cd Research-Codes
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the framework:
```bash
python aidm_framework.py
```

Launches a **Gradio interface** for:
- Generating virtual experts (via GPT-4)  
- Collecting decision criteria  
- Running AHP analysis  
- Exporting results to Excel  

---

## Example Workflow

1. Define criteria and alternatives (via interface or config file).  
2. Generate expert weights (human experts or GPT-4 virtual experts).  
3. Run **AHP eigenvalue analysis** with consistency validation.  
4. Export results to **Excel reports** with automatic audit trail.
